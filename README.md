# Phase one project - Beer information.
Welcome to the Beer Review App, a project created as part of the Flatiron School software engineering program. This project serves as an exercise to demonstrate key concepts learned during Phase One of the program, including event listeners, callback functions, array iteration, and CRUD operations.

## Features
Event Listeners: Explore how event listeners are used to capture user interactions with the app's interface.

Callback Functions: Understand the role of callback functions in handling user actions and asynchronous operations.

Array Iteration: Learn how to iterate through arrays to display and manipulate data dynamically.

CRUD Operations: Experience the implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing beer descriptions.

## Usage
To use the Beer Review App, you'll need to set up and run a JSON server to simulate a backend API for managing beer data. Follow these additional steps:

Install JSON Server globally: 
npm install -g json-server

Then start the JSON server to watch the included db.json file:
json-server --watch db.json
